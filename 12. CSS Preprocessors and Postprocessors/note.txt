SASS is a style sheet language that is compiled to css . Here we are allowed
to use vairable nested rules , mixin functions, pass parameter and so on.
all are fully compatible CSS .
It Promotes DRY(Dont repeat yourself).

Sass and SCSS are both syntaxes of the Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) preprocessor, but they are not exactly the same.

**Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets):

        Sass uses indentation to separate code blocks and omits the use of semicolons and curly braces.
        It has a more concise syntax.
        eg:-
        .nav
          width: 100%
          ul
            margin: 0
            padding: 0
            list-style: none


**SCSS (Sassy CSS):

        SCSS uses the CSS-like syntax with curly braces and semicolons.
        It is more familiar to users who are accustomed to traditional CSS.
        .nav {
            width: 100%;
            ul {
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
                list-style: none;
                 }
            }


indentation is the spaces or tabs to visually separate blocks of code
